This is an addon for [Paxi](https://modrinth.com/mod/paxi), serving four purposes:
- Backporting 1.21+ Paxi feature to 1.20.1 for loading packs from any folder in-game <sub>(See [#33](https://github.com/YUNG-GANG/Paxi/issues/33))</sub>
- Making it possible to use Paxi for built-in resourcepacks and datapacks added by mods <sub>(See [#27](https://github.com/YUNG-GANG/Paxi/issues/27))</sub>
- Restricting Paxi from auto-loading packs that is not listed in the load order
- Fixing a issue where developers is not able to get monetized with being embedded due to Modrinth not recognizing Paxi folder

#

### How to use?  
Unlike how old load order works, now you can specify directories in your instance's folder.  

Also, for using the built-in pack support, you need the ID of the pack. You can either check the mod's source code, try to guess it, or use the [Resource Pack Overrides](https://modrinth.com/mod/resource-pack-overrides) mod and hold **D** on the resourcepack screen to see the IDs of all packs.
