This is an addon for [Paxi](https://modrinth.com/mod/paxi), serving for three purposes:
- Porting 1.21 Paxi feature for loading packs from any folder in-game
- Restricting Paxi from auto-loading packs that is not listed in the load order
- Fixing a issue where developers is not able to get monetized with being embedded due to Modrinth not recognizing Paxi folder

#

How to use?  
- Unlike how old load order works, now you can specify directories in your instance's folder.
